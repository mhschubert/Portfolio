# Portfolio Overview

Here, I present some of the projects I did in the past (and which I am allowed to post on here). Some of them were part of the research papers I have worked on. Others I simply did for fun and to see how an implementation might work and look like.

Currently, you will find the following projects here:<br>
|Folder| Description| Link |Paper
| :------------- |:-------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| bio_algorithms | Implementation from scratch of an Ant Colony Organization Algorithm (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in python. |[Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/bio_algorithms)|-|
| classifier_outcome_comparison | Compares the impact of changes in the number of authors on classifier performance and feature importance. |[Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/classifier_outcome_comparison)| [Schubert (2021)](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/blob/main/classifier_outcome_comparison/figures/classifier_outcome_comparison.pdf)|
| compas | Analysis the COMPAS dataset and how decisions during the design stage of the algorithm affect the prediction result and biases. |[Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/compas)|Not yet available.|
|online_experiment | Implementation of an between-subject A/B-testing online experiment for a behavioral experiment. |[Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/online_experiment)|[Albrecht & Schubert (2021)](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/online_experiment/pdf)
| recipe_analysis| I love playing with data and I love cooking. So I combine the two by analysing a version of the yummly dataset.|[Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/recipe_analysis)|-|
| symbolic_regression| For one part of a research paper, I needed to reduce the number of clusters by finding commonalities. I did so using symbolic regression.|[Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/symbolic-regression/code)| Not yet available.|
| time-series_clustering| The project focuses on clustering observational time-series data in a meanigful way. I use unspervised learning with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for the clustering appraoch.|[Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/time-series_clustering/code)|[Engel, Hausladen & Schubert (2021)](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/blob/main/time-series_clustering/pdf/Engel_Hausladen_Schubert_Charting.pdf)|
| transformer_implementation| To better my understanding of transformer models in the area of NLP, I built a small translator using PyTorch | [Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/transformer_implementation/ml)| -|
|travel_with_ml| For this, I simply combined my passion for machine learning with my love for travelling and solved a TSP problem for a world trip. | [Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/travel_with_ml)|-|
|twitter_preprocessing| I needed to do some extensive preprocessing for a project involving Twitter data. To this end, I implemented a preprocessing routine using multiprocessing | [Direct Link](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/tree/main/twittter_preprocessing)| - |
