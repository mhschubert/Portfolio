# Travelling Salesman Solution via Biologically Inspired Algorithms

### Uses: machine learning; Backends: None - implementation from scratch in python

I like to travel and I like to play around with data and machine learning. So this is may way of combining both:
Solving the problem of how to travel all world capital cities, the US state capitals, and Kisumu (Kenya) (my fiance√© works there and it would be remiss of me not to visit). I use **biologically inspired** machine learning - it is basically "solving" a TSP problem.

Below you see the learning curves for the two algorithms:

As we can see, the ant colony algorithm outperforms the genetic one by at least one magnitude. Conseqeuntly, we use the latter for our travel plans:

The solution is good, especially on the continental level. However, there are sudden jumps - to the Seychelles, for example. As a result I would say, that if I were to use that algorithm for travel
plans, I would chunk the great problem into smaller parts (i.e. continent-wise) with fixed entry-exit points. That should optimize the solution found!
