# Using Dynamic Time Warping to Cluster Time Series of Group Interactions

In this project, I use time-series clustering with dynamic time warping data of group interactions. 
The data used is closely relate to that of experiments implementing the Public-Goods game (PGG) prevalent in behavioral research.
However, as the goal is to asses the quality of the result, I use simulated data as it gives us a ground truth 

The goal is to find a good algorithmic configuration to partition that kind of data in a meaningful way.

*Note*: The data needed to run the code is missing as I am not licensed to publicly share it. If you need it, please do not hestitate to contact me.

The working paper for which I designed the code can be found here: [Engel, Hausladen, Schubert (2021): Charting the Type Space: The Case of Linear Public-Good Experiments](https://github.com/mhschubert/Portfolio/blob/main/time-series_clustering/pdf/Engel_Hausladen_Schubert_Charting.pdf) (Authors are in alphabetical order)
